                Back in 2015, I was just a low-voltage electrical engineer working with PLC programs.
                It was at the urging of my friend that I first tumbled head into the rabbit hole of coding and web
                development.
                Fast forward to today, I've had the privilege of building software for a <span
                className="font-medium">start-up</span>
                , an <a className="font-medium" href="https://www.manulife.com/" target="_blank">international financial
                institution</a>,
                and a <a className="font-medium" href="https://english.cmbchina.com/" target="_blank">huge banking
                corporation</a>.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                My main focus these days is building SaaS enterprise products. In my free time I explore different
                technology stack.

                When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually taking leisurely strolls with my partner, indulging in diverse
                cuisines,
                or tackling endless traffic jam in <a className="font-medium"
